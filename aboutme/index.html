		<h2> Hobbies </h2>
		<h3> Cooking and Baking </h3>
		<p> Something I enjoy doing the most with my time is cooking with my flat mates. I was a vegetarian for 4 years which increased my love for food. <span class= "highlight"> Recently, I made pasta from scratch:</span>

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p>Currently I am working on my university assignments and am excited to be a part of the new more online-focused learning. I have a part-time job in a cafe in the covered market which I enjoy and have also started taking driving lessons in Oxford and like the challenge they pose.</p>

			<h2>Where Do I Live?</h2>
			<p>I was born in 2001 in Colchester, a town in Essex. Then in 2019 I moved to Oxford to complete my studies and it has since become my home. However, I am a keen traveller and recently saw New York which in my opinion is one of the greatest places in the world.</p>

		<div class="info">
			<h2>What Do I like?</h2>
			<p>I have a Sunglasses collection that I have been growing for about a year now. I enjoy finding lenses with different shapes and colours. Design and fashion are extremely interesting to me and I hope to partake in a few courses to take my interest further. </p>
